bonjour madame , voila mon compte rendu ,
reponse lab 3:


1.2.1 What type of instance variables does the Order class have?
   -  MyDate: we used an object of MyDate class
  -double ( orderAmount)
  -String ( product,costumer)
  -int ( quality)
 
 1.2.2 How is your MyDate class reused?
   we used an object of MyDate in the class Order and TestMyDate


1.2.3 How do you construct an Order?
   by creating a new Order object (using it s constructor)

1.2.4 How many Order objects are created in the main method of TestOrders?
  2 objects of  Order are created


2.4 Why should these last two methods be static methods, that is, have the staticmodifier?

methods setTaxRate and computeTaxOn do not  depend on anything except their arguments
so they can be generalised across the whole class


reponse lab 4:
2.2.3
Open the Order.java file in an editor view by double-clicking on the file name in the Package Explorer view.  What changes did this move create in your code ?


java can t recognize Mydate class because we didnt import it when we changed the location of Order.java
